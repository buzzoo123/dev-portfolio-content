  "about": {
    "content": "I'm a Computer Science and Math student at the University of Virginia, with industry experience at Amazon, Alarm.com, and 10Pearls. My focus is on full stack engineering and agentic AI development.\n\nI've engineered platforms serving thousands of users, built pipelines for multimodal AI, and created open-source frameworks for agentic development. My core stack includes React, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and cloud infrastructure (AWS + Azure).\n\nI thrive at the intersection of software and AI: designing systems that are scalable, modular, and capable of orchestrating intelligent agents. Outside of work, I love tennis, poker, and playing piano with my band.",
